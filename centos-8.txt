AppStream repository – The Application Stream repository provides all the applications you might want to run in a given userspace. Other software that has special licensing are available on a Supplemental repository.
What is AppStream?
The AppStream allows you to install additional versions of software on independent life cycles and keep your operating system up-to-date while having the right version of an application that suits your use case. Note that no two streams can be installed at the same time into the same userspace.

Application Streams are typically named according to the version of software it distributes e.g. mongodb:3.4 or mongodb:3.6, but may also use names such as “latest” and “stable” and “latest“.
